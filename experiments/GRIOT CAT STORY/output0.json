        "Repeat this story with no changes whatsoever: There was once a cat by the name of Thomas. This was no ordinary cat, however. Thomas was special. Not only was he wise beyond his years, but he also had the power to speak English. Born as a stray on the mean streets of London, the fight for survival was constant: running away from wild seagulls and competing for scraps outside the myriad fish and chip shops of Camden Market. Life for Thomas was dismal, until he met a barkeep named Roland. In the hustle and bustle of the markets, no one had noticed Thomas at all, let alone his conversational talents, until one fateful night.\r\nAfter closing Heorot Brewhaus, Roland encountered Thomas while leaving the pub, nearly tripping over the poor kitten. Tired and frustrated after a long shift, Roland exclaimed without restraint, \u201cGET YOUR FELINE KEISTER OUT OF HERE, YEH DELINQUENT KITTEN!\u201d Immediately, Roland heard a meek, \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\r\n\u201cOh, no worries,\u201d Roland replied, assuming he was addressing some imagined drunkard in the darkness, embarrassed by his outburst. \u201cIt's just all these damn strays,\u201d he continued.\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s rude. I am right here in front of you,\u201d said Thomas clearly.\r\nRoland looked around and realized he was alone, at least alone from other humans. \u201cWhere are you hiding?! Stop messing with me. I've had a long day at the pub, and I don\u2019t need any more problems!\u201d In a mixture of fear and frustration, Roland looked down at the sidewalk and saw something his eyes could barely believe, a stray kitten saying, \u201cI\u2019ve been right here this whole time, dummy.\u201d\r\nAfter the initial shock wore off, Roland had a brilliant idea. He would offer Thomas a job at the bar, the first bar in all of London with a talking cat. No, the world! That was sure to bring in the extra customers his boss had been worrying about. Thomas gladly accepted. He was no longer a stray, as Heorot Brewhaus quickly became his home.\r\nMany years passed, filled with days and nights of Thomas talking to various patrons, offering great advice and engaging conversation. Roland poured countless ales and Guinnesses, carefully cleaning every night after close, making sure the bar remained hospitable for Thomas and the customers. Heorot Brewhaus experienced unimaginable success. As word spread about Thomas, more and more people visited just to see the talking cat, often buying drinks while enveloped in deep discussions about the political and economic state of the world.\r\nThomas lived a great life. At the age of 18, he succumbed to his greatest weakness, working too hard. Thomas\u2019s soul began a long and arduous journey up the stairway to heaven. Meanwhile, Heorot Brewhaus descended into chaos. Roland was overwhelmed with grief. He had gone from laboring each night for menial pay, wondering if the bar would even remain open the following month, to becoming a mainstay at one of London's greatest institutions, complete with a 401(k) and work-life balance. It turned out Thomas wasn\u2019t the only one saved from scraps and seagulls on that fateful night when their paths crossed. Most importantly, Thomas had become a friend, and his loss weighed heavily on Roland.\r\nThe owner of Heorot Brewhaus had other concerns. Having just lost their most important employee, how could they continue to overcharge tourists for pints of domestic beer without a talking cat? Desperate for a solution, the owner came up with an idea. Taxidermying a cat might seem a bit odd, and the owner realized this, but he was desperate to retain the traffic and notoriety Thomas had brought the establishment. They decided on a compromise, not taxidermying all of Thomas, just his tail.\r\nA week passed, and Thomas\u2019s tail was mounted behind the bar. Roland found this distasteful at best but kept his opinion to himself. That night, a celebration of life was held for Thomas. People from across the globe came to mourn the passing of the talking cat, sharing stories of Thomas and the positive impact he had made.\r\nThomas finally arrived at the gates of heaven, guarded by Saint Peter. Thomas asked Peter for permission to enter, citing his innumerable great deeds and the help he'd offered through countless conversations. Peter agreed with Thomas but explained, \u201cUnfortunately, I cannot allow you to pass through these gates, Thomas. You have lived a great life filled to the brim with virtue and Guinness, but heaven does not accept a fractured soul, no matter the piety of its pieces.\u201d Thomas was upset but determined. He would descend back to Earth to retrieve the missing part of his soul, the tail hanging as a trophy at Heorot Brewhaus.\r\nThe funeral had been a lively event. Just as on the night the two friends had met, Roland found himself closing the bar alone. As the last glasses were washed and the tables cleaned, something remarkable happened. The door burst open with force, and a familiar voice filled the room: \u201cRoland, I need one last favor from an old friend. I need you to give me my tail back.\u201d\r\nRoland smiled faintly and shook his head, \u201cSorry Thomas, we can\u2019t retail spirits after hours.\u201d\r\n"
